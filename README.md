Hylas is a statically-typed, [wide-spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-spectrum_language), JIT-compiled dialect of Lisp that combines the performance and control of low-level languages with the advanced metaprogramming features of languages like Lisp.

# Examples

## Recursive Fibonacci Function:

```lisp
(function fib ((n i64)) i64
  (if (< n 2)
    n
    (+ (fib (- n 1))
       (fib (- n 2)))))
```

## Calling a foreign function:

```lisp
(foreign C printf (pointer i8) ... i32)

(printf "Hello, world! This is a double, in scientific notation: %e" 3.141592)
```

## Using a foreign library:

```lisp
(link "libSDL.so")

(foreign C SDL_Init i64 void)
(foreign C SDL_Delay i64 void)
(foreign C SDL_Quit void)

(type SDL_Color
  (structure
    (r            byte)
    (g            byte)
    (b            byte)
    (unused       byte)))
```
